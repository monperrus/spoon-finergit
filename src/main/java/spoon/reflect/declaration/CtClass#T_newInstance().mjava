/** 
 * Creates an instance of this class. Requirements: - the class must have a default constructor. - All dependencies (superclass, super-interfaces, imports) must be in the classpath, because the code is actually compiled (otherwise an exception is thrown) If the class has super-interfaces, the object can be cast to one of them. Otherwise, if the class has no super-interfaces, the methods can only be called with reflection. This instance is meant to be used for quick-testing, it uses a throwable classloader that will be garbage-collected with the instance.
