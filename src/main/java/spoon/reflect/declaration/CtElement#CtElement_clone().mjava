/** 
 * Clone the element which calls this method in a new object. Note that that references are kept as is, and thus, so if you clone whole classes or methods, some parts of the cloned element (eg executable references) may still point to the initial element. In this case, consider using methods  {@link spoon.refactoring.Refactoring#copyType(CtType)} and {@link spoon.refactoring.Refactoring#copyMethod(CtMethod)} instead which does additional work beyond cloning.
