/** 
 * Return all the accessible methods (concrete and abstract) for this type. It recursively collects all methods from super-classes and super-interfaces. It includes the methods of types whose source code is in the Spoon model, the methods of types from the JDK and from libraries present in the classpath, the methods of java.lang.Object (for all CtClass objects). However, in noclasspath mode, it does not include methods from unknown types. If methods are overridden somewhere in the type hierarchy, it returns only top methods (ie method definitions). Each method signature is returned only once
