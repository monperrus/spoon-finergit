/** 
 * Return all the accessible methods (concrete and abstract) for this type. It recursively collects all methods from super-classes and super-interfaces. As of 5.3: Really all methods (incl. those of library super-classes and Object are returned, thanks to runtime reflection) Up to 5.2: The recursion stops when the super-type/super-interface is not in the model, which means that no method of library super-classes, or of Object are present.
