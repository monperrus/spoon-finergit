/** 
 * Return all the methods that can be called on an instance of this type. It recursively collects all methods (both concrete and abstract) from all super-classes and all super-interfaces. It deduplicates methods with the same signature, which are defined several times somewhere in the type hierarchy. Warning: this method can be really slow due to signature deduplication. It includes all methods: the methods of types whose source code is in the Spoon model, the methods of types from the JDK and from libraries present in the classpath, the methods of java.lang.Object (for all CtClass objects). However, in noclasspath mode, it does not include methods from unknown types. If methods are overridden somewhere in the type hierarchy, it returns only top methods (ie method definitions).
